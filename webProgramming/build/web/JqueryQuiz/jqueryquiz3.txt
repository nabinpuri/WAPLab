1. Which, if any, of the following 3 code fragments are equivalent?
Explain why they are different, if they are. Explain why they can have
different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent.
//code fragment 1
$("li").each(function(idx, e) {
 $(e).css(â€œcolorâ€, â€œyellowâ€); });
//code fragment 2
$("li").each(function() {
 $(this).css(â€œcolorâ€, â€œyellowâ€); });
//code fragment 3
$("li").each(function(idx) {
 $(this).css(â€œcolorâ€, â€œyellowâ€); });
 
 
Ans:
	All of the above code are equivalent. The functions are being overloaded, by having different parameters. But they all are refering to the same object 
	either with 'this' or using the e parameter making all the code to do the same task.
 
 
2. Write a jQuery expression to find all divs on a page that include
an unordered list in them, and make their text color be blue.

Ans:
	$('div').has('ul').css('color','blue');
