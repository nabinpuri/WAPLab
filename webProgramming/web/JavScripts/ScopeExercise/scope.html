        <div>
  <ol>          
<li> <p>Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):</p>
    <pre>
x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
var x = 10;
document.write(x);
document.write(a);
var f = function(a, b, c) {
b = a;
document.write(b);
b = c;
var x = 5;
}
f(a,b,c);
document.write(b);
 }
c(8,9,10);
document.write(b);
document.write(x);
}</pre>

<li> <p>What is the difference between a method and function?</p>
    <p>Ans: A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It use parameters to operate on whereas a method is a type of function that is associated to an object. </p>
</li>
<li><p>What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</p>
    <p>
       this refers to the container class in java method in which the method is inside.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p>What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</p>
    <p>
        Inside a function, this points to the container object.
        <pre> 
            var item={
                    a:'2',
                    b:function(){
                        console.log(this.a);
                    }
            };
        </pre>
    </p>
</li>
<li><p>What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript function?</p>
    <p>Ans: 
        This value of this is determined by how a function is called. Inside a function it refers to the global object.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p>What is a free variable in JavaScript?</p>
    <p>Ans: A free variable inside a function is a variable that is not a part of its local variables or parameters. </p>
</li>
<li><p> Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
        that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.</p>
    <p>Ans: 
        <pre>var compare={
            name:'fred',
            major:'music',
            square: function(a,b){
                if(a==b) {return 4*a*a; }
                if(a < b){return a;}
                else {return b;}
                
            }
        }
        </pre>
